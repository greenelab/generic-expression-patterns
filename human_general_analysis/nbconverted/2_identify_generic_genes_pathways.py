# # Identify generic genes and pathways
# 
# Studies have found that some genes are more likely to be differentially expressed even across a wide range of experimental designs. These generic genes and subsequent pathways are not necessarily specific to the biological process being studied but instead represent a more systematic change.
# 
# This notebook identifies generic genes and pathways and then evaluates if those identified are consistent with published findings.
# 
# **Steps to identify generic genes:**
# 1. Simulates N gene expression experiments using [ponyo](https://github.com/ajlee21/ponyo)
# 2. Perform DE analysis to get association statistics for each gene
# 
#   In this case the DE analysis is based on the experimental design of the template experiment, described in the previous [notebook](1_process_recount2_data.ipynb). The template experiment is [SRP012656](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37764), which contains primary non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma tumors and adjacent normal tissues of 6 never-smoker Korean female patients. So the DE analysis is comparing tumor vs normal in this case.
# 
# 
# 3. For each gene, aggregate statsitics across all simulated experiments 
# 4. Rank genes based on this aggregated statistic (i.e. log fold change, or p-value)
# 
# 
# **Steps to identify generic gene sets (pathways):**
# 1. Using the same simulated experiments from above, perform GSEA analysis. This analysis will determine whether the genes contained in a gene set are clustered towards the beginning or the end of the ranked list of genes, where genes are ranked by log fold change, indicating a correlation with change in expression.
# 2. For each gene set (pathway), aggregate statistics across all simulated experiments
# 3. Rank gene sets based on this aggregated statistic
# 
# **Evaluation:**
# * We want to compare the ranking of genes identified using the above method with the ranking found from [Crow et. al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/13/6491.full.pdf), which identified a set of genes as generic based on how frequently they were found to be DE across 600 experiments
# * We want to compare the ranking of pathways identified using the above method with the ranking based on the [Powers et. al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/259440v1.full.pdf) data, where ranking was determined based on the fraction of 442 experiments a pathway was found to be enriched
# * This comparison will validate our method being used as a way to automatically identify generic genes and pathways.

# Studies have found that some genes are more likely to be differentially expressed even across a wide range of experimental designs. These *generic genes* are not necessarily specific to the biological process being studied but instead represent a more systematic change. 
# 
# We want to compare the ability to detect these generic genes using our method vs those found by [Crow et. al. publication](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/13/6491.full.pdf). Their genes are ranked 0 = not commonly DE; 1 = commonly DE. Genes by the number differentially expressed gene sets they appear in and then ranking genes by this score.

# **Takeaway:**
# Based on the correlation plot, we can see that our simulation method is very good at capturing variability in genes that are very low or very high in the DE rank (i.e. are significantly differentially expressed often across different studies). These results serve to validate that our method can be used to identify these generic genes, as we were able to recapitulate some of the generic genes as those identified by Crow et. al. Additionally, our method extends the Crow et. al. work, which used array data, and since here we used RNA-seq.

# ### GSEA 
# **Goal:** To detect modest but coordinated changes in prespecified sets of related genes (i.e. those genes in the same pathway or share the same GO term).
# 
# 1. Rank all genes using DE association statistics. In this case we used the p-value scores to rank genes. logFC returned error -- need to look into this.
# 2. An enrichment score (ES) is defined as the maximum distance from the middle of the ranked list. Thus, the enrichment score indicates whether the genes contained in a gene set are clustered towards the beginning or the end of the ranked list (indicating a correlation with change in expression). 
# 3. Estimate the statistical significance of the ES by a phenotypic-based permutation test in order to produce a null distribution for the ES (i.e. scores based on permuted phenotype)

# Studies have found that there are some pathways (gene sets) that are more likely to be significantly enriched in DEGs across a wide range of experimental designs. These generic pathways are not necessarily specific to the biological process being studied but instead represents a more systematic change.
# 
# We want to compare the ability to detect these generic pathways using our method vs those found by [Powers et. al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/259440v1.full.pdf) publication.  We will use the `Hallmarks_qvalues_GSEAPreranked.csv` file from https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11806255 as a reference. The file contains the q-value (adjusted p-value) for the test: given the enrichment score (ES) of the experiment is significant compared to the null distribution of enrichment scores, where the null set is generated from permuted gene sets. For each gene set (pathway) they calculate the q-value using this test. 
# 
# 
# To get a `reference ranking`, we calculate the fraction of experiments that a given pathway was significant (q-value <0.05) and use this rank pathways. `Our ranking` is to rank pathways based on the median q-value across the simulated experiments. We can then compare `our ranking` versus the `reference ranking.`

# **Takeaway:**
# 
# * The above shows that there is no correlation between our ranking (where pathways were ranked using median adjusted p-value score across simulated experiments) vs Powers et. al. ranking (where pathways were ranked based on the fraction of experiments they had adjusted p-value < 0.05). This is using the same workflow used to compare ranking of genes. 
# 
# * We validated that our analysis pipeline is working correctly by comparing pathway ranks obtained from a (Powers et. al.)-trained VAE model vs pathway ranking based on manual curation using Powers et. al datasets. We expect to see a high correlation between pathway ranks given that we are using the same training dataset. Indeed that is what we find [here](../human_cancer_analysis/2_identify_generic_genes_pathways.ipynb).
# 
# **Therefore,** 
# 
# * We find relatively similar generic genes using our simulation approach (i.e. VAE model trained on a cancer-specific dataset, Powers et. al.) compared to generic genes found from real general experiments from Crow et. al. These generic genes are not that context-specific at the extremes.
# 
# * We found very different generic pathways training using our simulation approach trained on a general dataset (recount2) compared to generic pathways found from real cancer-specific experiments from Powers et. al. See [analysis](../human_cancer_analysis/2_identify_generic_genes_pathways.ipynb). But we get very similar generic pathways using our simulation approach trained on a cancer-specific dataset (Powers et. al.) compared with generic pathways found from cancer-specific dataset (Powers et. al.). This indicates that generic pathways are more context specific. 
# 
# * I need to think about about why there is a difference in genes vs pathways.
