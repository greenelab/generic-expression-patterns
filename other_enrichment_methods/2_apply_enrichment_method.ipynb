    "## Apply enrichment method\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to show that SOPHIE can be easily extended to use multiple different enrichment methods. The enrichment methods were selected from [Geistlinger et. al. paper](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/22/1/545/5722384). We selected a subset of the methods in the paper based on those that could 1) be applied to both RNA-seq and array data and 2)those that covered a wide range of statistical performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods we selected were (description of the methods are below):\n",
    "* GSEA\n",
    "* GSVA\n",
    "* CAMERA\n",

    "\n",
    "These methods have a range of different characteristics:\n",
    "* Runtime: GSEA has the longest runtime compared to CAMERA which has the shortest, GSVA and ORA are in the middle\n",
    "* Type of method: GSVA is self-contained vs the others are competative\n",
    "* Number of gene sets found to be statistically signficant: GSVA found the most (median ~70%), CAMERA found ~25% and ORA and GSEA found very few"

    "## Enrichment methods\n",
    "These methods are important because they permit differential expression questions to be posed in terms of ensembles of genes representing pathways or other biologically interpretable processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main groups of methods: ‘self-contained’ gene set tests examine a set of genes in their own right without reference to other genes in the genome whereas ‘competitive’ gene set tests compare genes in the test set relative to all other genes. Self-contained tests are of interest for assessing the relevance of an individual biological process to the experiment at hand, whereas the competitive tests focus more on distinguishing the most important biological processes from those that are less important. Competitive tests are overwhelmingly more commonly used in the genomic literature. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458527/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [CAMERA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458527/) (Correlation Adjusted MEan RAnk gene set test) is based on the idea of estimating the variance inflation factor associated with inter-gene correlation, and incorporating this into parametric or rank-based test procedures. (available in limma) \n",
    "  * Competitive gene set test\n",
    "  * Performs the same rank-based test procedure as GSEA, but also estimates the correlation between genes, instead of treating genes as independent\n",
    "  * Recall GSEA: 1) Rank all genes using DE association statistics. 2) An enrichment score (ES) is defined as the maximum distance from the middle of the ranked list. Thus, the enrichment score indicates whether the genes contained in a gene set are clustered towards the beginning or the end of the ranked list (indicating a correlation with change in expression). 3) Estimate the statistical significance of the ES by a phenotypic-based permutation (permute samples assigned to label) test in order to produce a null distribution for the ES (i.e. scores based on permuted phenotype)\n",
    "  * Appropriate for small and large fold changes\n",
    "* [GSVA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3618321/) (Gene Set Variation Analysis) calculates sample-wise gene set enrichment scores as a function of genes inside and outside the gene set. This method is well-suited for assessing gene set variation across a dichotomous phenotype. (biocontuctor package GSVA) \n",
    "  * Self-contained gene set test\n",
    "  * Estimates variation of gene set enrichment over the samples independently of any class label\n",
    "* [ORA](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/clusterProfiler/versions/3.0.4/topics/enricher) (over-representation analysis) uses the hypergeometric test to determine if there a significant over-representation of pathway in the selected set of DEGs. Here we're using clusterProfiler library but there are multiple options for this analysis.
